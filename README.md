# AWS Lambda Functions
Task 3.1: Lambda Function to Add Two Numbers and Return the Result
Write an AWS Lambda function that takes two numbers as input, adds them, and returns the result.

Task 3.2: Lambda Function to Store a Document or PDF File in an S3 Bucket
Write an AWS Lambda function that stores a document or PDF file (provided as a base64-encoded string) in an S3 bucket.

**Steps to Run the AWS Lambda Functions**
Prerequisites:
An AWS account.
AWS CLI installed and configured with your AWS credentials. If you don't have it, you can install and configure it using this guide.
IAM Role with the necessary permissions for AWS Lambda and S3. The role should have policies such as AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole and AmazonS3FullAccess attached to it.
Task 3.1: AWS Lambda Function to Add Two Numbers
Create the Lambda Function:

Log in to the AWS Management Console.
Go to the Lambda service.
Click on Create function and select Author from scratch.
Set the function name, e.g., AddNumbersFunction.
Choose an existing role or create a new one with basic Lambda permissions.
cd Frontend_Django_AWS_Tasks/Task3
use the lambda_function.py code 
Deploy the Function:

Click on Deploy to save the function.
Test the Function:
Create a test event with the following JSON payload to test the function:

{
  "num1": 5,
  "num2": 3
}

# Task 3.2: AWS Lambda Function to Store a Document or PDF in an S3 Bucket
Create the Lambda Function:

Go to the AWS Lambda service in the AWS Management Console.
Click on Create function and select Author from scratch.
Set the function name, e.g., StoreFileInS3.
Choose an existing role or create a new one with the necessary S3 permissions.
use the lambda_func_s3_bucket.py code

Deploy the Function:

Click on Deploy to save the function.

### Test the Function:###

Create a test event with the following JSON payload to test the function:

{
  "file_content": "base64_encoded_file_content_here",
  "file_name": "document.pdf",
  "bucket_name": "your-s3-bucket-name"
}

By following these steps in your README, you should be able to execute all the tasks without any issues, provided the prerequisites (like AWS CLI and IAM roles) are met.
